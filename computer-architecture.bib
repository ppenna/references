@article{Cavalcante2020,
    abstract = { In this article, we present Ara, a 64-bit vector
                 processor based on the version 0.5 draft of RISC-V's vector
                 extension, implemented in GlobalFoundries 22FDX fully
                 depleted silicon-on-insulator (FD-SOI) technology. Ara's
                 microarchitecture is scalable, as it is composed of a set of
                 identical lanes, each containing part of the processor's
                 vector register file and functional units. It achieves up to
                 97% floating-point unit (FPU) utilization when running a 256
                 × 256 double-precision matrix multiplication on 16 lanes.
                 Ara runs at more than 1 GHz in the typical corner (TT/0.80
                 V/25 °C), achieving a performance up to 33
                 DP-GFLOPS. In terms of energy efficiency, Ara achieves up to
                 41 DP-GFLOPS W -1 under the same conditions, which is
                 slightly superior to similar vector processors found in the
                 literature. An analysis on several vectorizable linear
                 algebra computation kernels for a range of different matrix
                 and vector sizes gives insight into performance limitations
                 and bottlenecks for vector processors and outlines
                 directions to maintain high energy efficiency even for small
                 matrix sizes where the vector architecture achieves
                 suboptimal utilization of the available FPUs.

@article{Flynn1972,
	abstract = { A hierarchical model of computer organizations is
				 developed, based on a tree model using request/service type
				 resources as nodes. Two aspects of the model are
				 distinguished: logical and physical. General parallel- or
				 multiple-stream organizations are examined as to type and
				 effectiveness-especially regarding intrinsic logical
				 difficulties. The overlapped simplex processor (SISD) is
				 limited by data dependencies. Branching has a particularly
				 degenerative effect. The parallel processors
				 [single-instruction stream-multiple-data stream (SIMD)] are
				 analyzed. In particular, a nesting type explanation is
				 offered for Minsky's conjecture-the performance of a
				 parallel processor increases as log M instead of M (the
				 number of data stream processors).
				 Multiprocessors (MIMD) are subjected to a saturation
				 syndrome based on general communications lockout.
				 Simplified queuing models indicate that saturation
				 develops when the fraction of task time spent locked out
				 (L/E) approaches 1/n, where n is the number of
				 processors. Resources sharing in multiprocessors can be
				 used to avoid several other classic organizational
				 problems.

	abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) numerical simulation is an
				indispensable technique for various analyses of physical
				phenomena, but it generally requires numerous computation.
				In this paper, we propose an FPGA-based accelerator for 3D
				numerical simulations and focus on acceleration of the 3D
				finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. This
				accelerator consists of a 2D single instruction multiple
				data (SIMD) array processor, and it can execute 3D parallel
				computing with little data transfer overhead by applying
				virtual processing-elements cuboid (VPEC) with synchronous
				shift data transfer. We demonstrate that the experimental
				hardware implemented on an Altera Stratix V FPGA
				(5SGSMD5K2F40C2N) is 3.1 times faster than parallel
				computing on the NVIDIA Tesla C2075, and it reaches a 94.57%
				operating rate of the calculation units for the computation
				of the 3D FDTD method. The proposed accelerator is suitable
				for multi-chip composition.

                 multimedia, communications, and other numeric-intensive
                 applications. It uses a SIMD (single-instruction,
                 multiple-data) technique to exploit the parallelism
                 inherent in many algorithms, producing full application
                 performance of 1.5 to 2 times faster than the same
                 applications run on the same processor without MMX. The
                 extension also maintains full compatibility with existing IA
                 microprocessors, operating systems, and applications while
                 providing new instructions and data types that applications

    abstract = { This paper proposes a vision chip hybrid architecture
                 with dynamically reconfigurable processing element (PE) array
                 processor and self-organizing map (SOM) neural network. It
                 integrates a high speed CMOS image sensor, three von
                 Neumann-type processors, and a non-von Neumann-type
                 bio-inspired SOM neural network. The processors consist of a
                 pixel-parallel PE array processor with O(N×N) parallelism, a
                 row-parallel row-processor (RP) array processor with O(N)
                 parallelism and a thread-parallel dual-core microprocessor
                 unit (MPU) with O(2) parallelism. They execute low-, mid-
                 and high-level image processing, respectively. The SOM
                 network speeds up high-level processing in pattern
                 recognition tasks by O(N/4×N/4), which improves the chip
                 performance remarkably. The SOM network can be dynamically
                 reconfigured from the PE array to largely save chip area. A
                 prototype chip with a 256 × 256 image sensor, a
                 reconfigurable 64 × 64 PE array processor/16 × 16 SOM
                 network, a 64 × 1 RP array processor and a dual-core 32-bit
                 MPU was implemented in a 0.18 $\mu$m CMOS image sensor
                 process. The chip can perform image capture and
                 various-level image processing at a high speed and in
                 flexible fashion. Various complicated applications including
                 M-S functional solution, horizon estimation, hand gesture
                 recognition, face recognition are demonstrated at high speed
                 from several hundreds to >1000 fps.

                 analytics, machine learning, and scientific computing demand
                 ever growing floating-point operations per second under
                 tight area- and energy-efficiency constraints.
                 Application-specific architectures and accelerators, while
                 efficient at a given task, are hard to adjust to algorithmic
                 changes. In this work, we present Manticore, a
                 general-purpose, ultra-efficient, RISC-V, chiplet-based
                 architecture for data-parallel floating-point workloads. We
                 have manufactured a 9mm^2 prototype of the chiplet's
                 computational core in Globalfoundries 22nm FD-SOI process
                 and demonstrate more than 2.5x improvement in energy
                 efficiency on floating-point intensive workloads compared to
                 high performance compute engines (CPUs and GPUs), despite
                 their more advanced FinFET process. The prototype contains
                 two 64-bit, application-class RISC-V Ariane management cores
                 that run a full-fledged Linux OS. The compute capability at
                 high energy and area efficiency is provided by Snitch
                 clusters. Each cluster contains eight small (20kGE) 32-bit
                 integer RISC-V cores, each controlling a large
                 double-precision floating-point unit (120kGE). Each core
                 supports two custom RISC-V ISA extensions: FREP and SSR. The
                 SSR extension elides explicit load and store instructions by
                 encoding them as register reads and writes. The FREP
                 extension mostly decouples the integer core from the FPU by
                 allowing a sequence buffer to issue instructions to the FPU
                 independently. Both extensions allow the tiny, single-issue,
                 integer core to saturate the instruction bandwidth of the FPU
                 and achieve FPU utilization above 90%, with more than 80% of
                 core area dedicated to the FPU.
