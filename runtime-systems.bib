    abstract = { The ever-growing number of cores in embedded chips
                emphasizes more than ever the complexity inherent to parallel
                pro- gramming. To solve these programmability issues, there
                is a renewed interest in the dataflow paradigm. In this
                context, we present a compilation toolchain for the ΣC
                language, which allows the hierarchical construction of
                stream applications and automatic mapping of this
                application to an embedded manycore target. As a
                demonstration of this toolchain, we present an
                implementation of a H.264 encoder and evaluate its
                performance on Kalray's embedded manycore MPPA chip.

@article{Blumofe1996,
    abstract = { Cilk (pronounced “silk”) is a C-based runtime system for
                 multithreaded parallel programming. In this paper, we document the
                 efficiency of the Cilk work-stealing scheduler, both empirically and
                 analytically. We show that on real and synthetic applications, the
                 “work” and “critical-path length” of a Cilk computation can be used
                 to model performance accurately.  Consequently, a Cilk programmer
                 can focus on reducing the computation's work and critical-path
                 length, insulated from load balancing and other runtime scheduling
                 issues.  We also prove that for the class of “fully strict”
                 (well-structured) programs, the Cilk scheduler achieves space, time,
                 and communication bounds all within a constant factor of optimal. The
                 Cilk runtime system currently runs on the Connection Machine CM5
                 MPP, the Intel Paragon MPP, the Sun Sparcstation SMP, and the
                 Cilk-NOW network of workstations. Applications written in Cilk
                 include protein folding, graphic rendering, backtrack search, and
                 the ★Socrates chess program, which won second prize in the 1995 ICCA
                 World Computer Chess Championship.

@inproceedings{Varghese2014,
    abstract = { With energy efficiency and power consumption being the
                 primary impediment in the path to exascale systems, low-power
                 high performance embedded systems are of increasing
                 interest. The Parallella System-on-module (SoM) created by
                 Adapteva combines the Epiphany-IV 64-core coprocessor with a
                 host ARM processor housed in a Zynq System-on-chip. The
                 Epiphany integrates low-power RISC cores on a 2D mesh
                 network and promises up to 70 GFLOPS/Watt of processing
                 efficiency. However, with just 32 KB of memory per eCore for
                 storing both data and code, and only low level inter-core
                 communication support, programming the Epiphany system
                 presents several challenges. In this paper we evaluate the
                 performance of the Epiphany system for a variety of basic
                 compute and communication operations. Guided by this data we
                 explore various strategies for implementing stencil based
                 application codes on the Epiphany system. With future
                 systems expected to house 4096 eCores, the merits of the
                 Epiphany architecture as a path to exascale is compared to
                 other competing power efficient systems.
