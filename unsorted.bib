But efficient DSMs are needed because they can significantly simplify the implementation of complex distributed algorithms. This paper discusses implications of the many-core evolution and derives a set of reusable elementary operations for future software DSMs. These elementary operations will help in exploring and evaluating new memory models and consistency protocols.},
