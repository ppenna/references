                 for finding the largest (or smallest) of a set of uniquely
                 numbered processes arranged in a circle, in which no central
                 controller exists and the number of processes is not
                 known a priori. This decentralized algorithm uses a
                 technique of selective message extinction in order to
                 achieve an average number of message passes of order (n
                 log n) rather than O (n^2).

@article{Garcia-Molina1982,
    abstract = { After a failure occurs in a distributed computing
                 system, it is often necessary to reorganize the active nodes so
                 that they can continue to perform a useful task. The first
                 step in such a reorganization or reconfiguration is to elect
                 a coordinator node to manage the operation. This paper
                 discusses such elections and reorganizations. Two types of
                 reasonable failure environments are studied. For each
                 environment assertions which define the meaning of an
                 election are presented. An election algorithm which
                 satisfies the assertions is presented for each
                 environment.

@article{Lamport1978,
    abstract  = { The concept of one event happening before another in a
                  distributed system is examined, and is shown to define a partial
                  ordering of the events. A distributed algorithm is given for
                  synchronizing a system of logical clocks which can be used
                  to totally order the events. The use of the total ordering
                  is illustrated with a method for solving synchronization
                  problems. The algorithm is then specialized for
                  synchronizing physical clocks, and a bound is derived on how
                  far out of synchrony the clocks can become.
