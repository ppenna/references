@inproceedings{Engler1995,
    abstract  = { Traditional operating systems limit the performance,
                  flexibility, and functionality of applications by fixing the
                  interface and implementation of operating system
                  abstractions such as interprocess communication and virtual
                  memory. The exokernel operating system architecture
                  addresses this problem by providing application-level
                  management of physical resources. In the exokernel
                  architecture, a small kernel securely exports all hardware
                  resources through a low- level interface to untrusted
                  library operating systems. Library operating systems use
                  this interface to implement system objects and policies.
                  This separation of resource protection from management
                  allows application-specific customization of traditional
                  operating system abstractions by extending, specializing, or
                  even replacing libraries. We have implemented a prototype
                  exokernel operating system. Measurements show that most
                  primitive kernel operations (such as exception handling and
                  protected control transfer) are ten to 100 times
                  faster than in Ultrix, a mature monolithic UNIX operating
                  system. In addition, we demonstrate that an exokernel
                  allows applications to control machine resources in ways not
                  possible in traditional operating systems. For instance,
                  virtual memory and interprocess communication abstractions are
                  implemented entirely within an application-level library.
                  Measurements show that application-level virtual memory and
                  interprocess communication primitives are five to 40 times
                  faster than Ultrix’s kernel primitives. Compared to
                  state-of-the-art implementations from the literature, the
                  prototype exokernel system is at least five times faster on
                  operations such as exception dispatching and interprocess
                  communication.

Many of the decisions behind today's most popular operating systems have remained unchanged, even as hardware and software have evolved. Operating systems form the foundation of almost every software stack, so inadequacies in present systems have a pervasive impact. This paper describes the efforts of the Singularity project to re-examine these design choices in light of advances in programming languages and verification tools. Singularity systems incorporate three key architectural features: software-isolated processes for protection of programs and system services, contract-based channels for communication, and manifest-based programs for verification of system properties. We describe this foundation in detail and sketch the ongoing research in experimental systems that build upon it.},

abstract = { Distributed operating systems have many aspects in common with
             centralized ones, but they also differ in certain ways. This paper
             is intended as an introduction to distributed operating systems,
             and especially to current university research about them. After a
             discussion of what constitutes a distributed operating system and
             how it is distinguished from a computer network, various key design
             issues are discussed. Then several examples of current research
             projects are examined in some detail, namely, the Cambridge
             Distributed Computing System, Amoeba, V, and Eden.

@inproceedings{Zhang2019,
    abstract = { Researchers have long predicted the demise of the operating
                 system [21, 26, 41]. As datacenter servers increasingly
                 incorporate I/O devices that let applications bypass the OS
                 kernel (e.g., RDMA [12] and DPDK [15] network devices or SPDK
                 storage devices), this prediction may finally come true. While
                 kernel-bypass devices do eliminate the OS kernel from the I/O
                 path, they do not handle the kernel's most important job:
                 offering higher-level abstractions. This paper argues for a new
                 high-level, device-agnostic I/O abstraction for kernel-bypass
                 devices. We propose the Demikernel, a new library OS
                 architecture for kernel-bypass devices. It defines a
                 high-level, kernel-bypass I/O abstraction and provides
                 user-space library OSes to implement that abstraction across a
                 range of kernel-bypass devices. The Demikernel makes
                 applications easier to build, portable across devices, and
                 unmodified as devices continue to evolve.
