@inproceedings{Engler1995,
    abstract  = { Traditional operating systems limit the performance,
                  flexibility, and functionality of applications by fixing the
                  interface and implementation of operating system
                  abstractions such as interprocess communication and virtual
                  memory. The exokernel operating system architecture
                  addresses this problem by providing application-level
                  management of physical resources. In the exokernel
                  architecture, a small kernel securely exports all hardware
                  resources through a low- level interface to untrusted
                  library operating systems. Library operating systems use
                  this interface to implement system objects and policies.
                  This separation of resource protection from management
                  allows application-specific customization of traditional
                  operating system abstractions by extending, specializing, or
                  even replacing libraries. We have implemented a prototype
                  exokernel operating system. Measurements show that most
                  primitive kernel operations (such as exception handling and
                  protected control transfer) are ten to 100 times
                  faster than in Ultrix, a mature monolithic UNIX operating
                  system. In addition, we demonstrate that an exokernel
                  allows applications to control machine resources in ways not
                  possible in traditional operating systems. For instance,
                  virtual memory and interprocess communication abstractions are
                  implemented entirely within an application-level library.
                  Measurements show that application-level virtual memory and
                  interprocess communication primitives are five to 40 times
                  faster than Ultrix’s kernel primitives. Compared to
                  state-of-the-art implementations from the literature, the
                  prototype exokernel system is at least five times faster on
                  operations such as exception dispatching and interprocess
                  communication.

@article{Tanenbaum1985,
abstract = { Distributed operating systems have many aspects in common with
             centralized ones, but they also differ in certain ways. This paper
             is intended as an introduction to distributed operating systems,
             and especially to current university research about them. After a
             discussion of what constitutes a distributed operating system and
             how it is distinguished from a computer network, various key design
             issues are discussed. Then several examples of current research
             projects are examined in some detail, namely, the Cambridge
             Distributed Computing System, Amoeba, V, and Eden.
